 ## AWS GLOBAL INFRA

 What Are AWS Regions?
 - a physical location around the world where AWS clusters data centers.
 - Each Region consists of multiple, isolated, and physically separate Availability Zones within a geographic area
 - Currently, AWS operates over 30 Regions globally


 Key Characteristics
 a. Geographic Isolation
 - typically hundreds of miles apart.
 - Why? n event of natural disasters, political events, or infrastructure failures in one Region donâ€™t impact others.
- E.g: US East (N. Virginia) Region is fully independent from US West (Oregon), supporting DR


b. Regulatory Compliance
- Each Region operates under the local laws and regulations of its geographic location.
So, it enables you meet data sovereignty requirements

- E.g:  EU customers can ensure their data remains in Europe by selecting EU-based Regions.

c. Service Availability
- not every service is available in every Region
- New services typically appear in major Regions first and expand globally later. 
- This affects architectural decisions and service selection based on the Region you choose.


d. Strategic Role in Global Infra

- AWS Regions enable global application deployment, letting you place infrastructure near users for optimal latency.
- Achieve true global reach and improve user experience through this..


e. DR and Business Continuity
- Regions provide natural boundaries for disaster recovery.
- can replicate critical data and workloads across Regions to ensure business continuity,  in the event of a complete regional outage. 
- This multi-Region approach supports enterprise-grade DR strategies.


f. Compliance and Data Governance
- Many organizations must control where data is stored and processed
- AWS Regions offer geographic control needed to meet these req. while maintaining "cloud scalability."

## Purpose of Availability Zones and Their Role in High Availability

AZs - fundamental building blocks for creating fault-tolerant architectures within AWS Regions
by providing the infrastructure foundation for high availability and disaster recovery at the data center level.


What are AZs?
- one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region.

-  Each AZ is isolated from other AZs in the same Region, yet connected through high-speed, low-latency links.
So the architecture provides:
    isolation for fault tolerance &; 
    connectivity for seamless operation.

- Each Region contains multiple AZs: typically between 2 and 6, with newer Regions generally offering 3 or more.

- AZs are represented by a letter suffix after the Region code
E.g:
    us-east-1a
    us-east-1b,
    us-east-1c
